##Project: Dog Bread Image Classification 
Team Members: Taylor Witte, Donald Yu, Praveen Manimaran, Vitush Agarwal, Parker Aman

##Abstract: 
This project uses the Dog Breeds Image Classification dataset to develop an interactive breed classification system using Apache Spark and its machine learning libraries. The system is designed to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds with high accuracy, allowing for breed identification through images. This capability enhances engagement and has practical applications in educational, veterinary, and personal settings. Advanced image processing techniques and deep learning models are employed within Spark to extend the capabilities of real-time data processing and machine learning. The project aims to provide a novel tool that is accessible to the public and sufficiently robust for professional use. 

##Data Set:
